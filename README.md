# graphene-django library
This is a follow along project from DjangoCon 21 with Dane Hillard.

I have been exploring GraphQL as the most viable framework for a complex relational memory structure. This type of memory structure would have (k) applications in real world data management and graphQL's easy endpoint is super enticing. This is a minimal example of a graph implementation.
